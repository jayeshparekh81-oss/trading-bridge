# Multi-Instrument Isolation Audit

- **Date:** 2026-06-28
- **Status:** Design-phase reference. Read-only audit — nothing built from this yet.

> **Live BSE / CDSL / ANGELONE FUTURES (`is_paper=false`) must stay byte-for-byte untouched.** This document maps where instrument-type is (and isn't) decided so a future cash/option pipeline can be fully isolated from the live futures execution path.

---

## PART 1 — Audit: where instrument-type is decided

### Headline
There is **no instrument-type column** anywhere. "It's futures" is enforced structurally by the executor passing **`Exchange.NFO` as a constant** at every call site, which then forces NRML. That hardcode is the isolation seam.

### 1. The `Exchange.NFO` hardcode chokepoint
The live path does not *read* instrument type — it *hardcodes* it. Every executor/exit call site passes `exchange=Exchange.NFO`:
- `strategy_executor.py:232` (entry)
- `direct_exit.py:257, 429, 607` (exits)
- Comment at `strategy_executor.py:216-218`: *"pass Exchange.NFO … current TRADETRI is F&O-only; multi-exchange routing is a separate epic."*

Broker layer (`dhan.py`) already has the vocabulary for other instruments — `ProductType{INTRADAY, DELIVERY=CNC, MARGIN, BO, CO}`, `Exchange→segment{NSE_EQ, BSE_EQ, NSE_FNO, BSE_FNO, MCX_COMM, NSE_CURRENCY}` — so cash and options are *representable* at the broker, but never *reached* from the live path.

### 2. `_resolve_product_type` (incl. the dead equity branch)
`strategy_executor.py:682-715`:
```python
_FNO_EXCHANGES = frozenset({Exchange.NFO, Exchange.BFO, Exchange.CDS, Exchange.MCX})
_FORBIDDEN_FNO_PAYLOAD_PRODUCT_TYPES = frozenset({"INTRADAY", "MIS"})

def _resolve_product_type(signal, exchange: Exchange = Exchange.NFO) -> ProductType:
    raw = str((signal.raw_payload or {}).get("product_type") or "").upper()
    is_fno = exchange in _FNO_EXCHANGES
    if is_fno:
        if raw in _FORBIDDEN_FNO_PAYLOAD_PRODUCT_TYPES:
            raise InvalidProductTypeError(...)        # permanent rule 1
        return ProductType.MARGIN                     # F&O → NRML, regardless of payload
    # Equity path — payload wins; default DELIVERY (CNC)
    if not raw:
        return ProductType.DELIVERY
    return _PRODUCT_TYPE_FROM_PAYLOAD.get(raw, ProductType.DELIVERY)
```
- F&O → always MARGIN (NRML); INTRADAY/MIS payload → `InvalidProductTypeError` (permanent rule 1, incident 2026-05-20).
- **The equity branch (`DELIVERY`/`CNC`) already exists but is UNREACHABLE** in the live path — it only fires if a caller passes a non-NFO exchange, and no caller ever does. This is both a footgun (a future caller could silently route equity through the same executor) and a latent capability.
- Defense-in-depth: `dhan.py:1280-1285` also traps INTRADAY for F&O (3-layer enforcement).

### 3. Strategy model / webhook instrument fields
- **`strategy.py` (Strategy model): NO `instrument_type` / `product_type` / `asset_type` / `segment` column.** Only `strategy_json` JSONB (which *can* nest an `"options"` block) + `allowed_symbols`. Instrument type is **implicit-futures**.
- **Webhook payload:** `schemas/strategy_webhook.py:123-124` accepts optional `instrument_type` and `product_type`. `product_type` *is* consumed (by `_resolve_product_type` via `raw_payload`); **`instrument_type` is accepted but NOT consumed by execution routing** (only `pine_mapper.is_options_strategy` reads a forward-compat `getattr(strategy, "instrument_type")` that does not exist as a column yet).
- `templates/` carry an `instrument_type` enum, but as **catalog metadata only** — not wired to execution.

### 4. `futures_resolver` — assumes futures
Futures-specific. Continuous notation (`BSE1!`) → month-stamped `BSE-MAY2026-FUT`; `_CANONICAL_FUT_RE = ^([A-Z][A-Z0-9]*)-[A-Z]{3}\d{4}-FUT$` matches **only `-FUT`**; everything else **passes through unchanged** (`resolve_or_passthrough`). Not instrument-aware — cash symbols would pass through untouched; options use a separate resolver (`pine_mapper`).

### 5. Existing options Phase-2B scaffold (dormant, paper-only)
- `pine_mapper.py`: `resolve_atm_strike`, `resolve_strike`, `resolve_options_expiry`, `resolve_option_type` (CE/PE), and the **instrument decision point** `is_options_strategy(strategy)` (`:469-483`): detection order = explicit `instrument_type` attr → `strategy_json.instrument_type == "options"` → presence of a `strategy_json.options` block.
- `schemas/pine_webhook.py`: `PineAlertPayload.spot_price`, `OptionsConfig`, `StrikeSelection`, the **NRML carry-forward mandate**, `_FORBIDDEN_PRODUCTS = {MIS, INTRADAY}`.
- `indicators/calculations/atm_strike_distance.py`; scrip-master option-triplet parsing in `dhan.py`.
- Options still route via **`Exchange.NFO` / `BFO` → NRML** (inherit the underlying's F&O segment). Roughly half-built; paper-only; not flipped on.

### 6. Cash / equity = NO execution path
There is **no cash execution path**. Only latent pieces exist: the unreachable `DELIVERY`/`CNC` branch in `_resolve_product_type` + broker `NSE_EQ`/`BSE_EQ` segments. A cash pipeline is a ground-up build.

### Isolation summary
The live futures path is well-isolated *by accident of being hardcoded*. Three structural facts protect it: (1) the `Exchange.NFO` constant at the executor call sites; (2) the dead equity branch (reachable only via a non-NFO exchange that nobody passes); (3) no instrument-type decision exists for cash today. The clean design is to branch on instrument-type **above** `place_strategy_orders` and give cash/options their own executor + resolver, leaving the NFO-hardcoded futures call sites and `futures_resolver` byte-for-byte untouched.

## DECISIONS & DESIGN (2026-06-28)

- **Status:** Design-phase. Read-only audit. Nothing built.

> **Live BSE/CDSL/ANGELONE FUTURES (`is_paper=false`) must stay byte-for-byte untouched. All real-money multi-instrument work is GATED on SEBI clarity; Stage 1 = paper only.**

### Founder decision
- Support **THREE instrument types for subscribers: Cash / Option / Future.** Founder's call — lets small-capital customers pick affordable instruments and upgrade as confidence grows.

### Instrument reality (effort + risk)
- **FUTURES:** done, live, tested — **DO NOT TOUCH.**
- **OPTIONS:** ~half-built dormant Phase-2B scaffold exists (strike/expiry/CE-PE resolvers, `is_options_strategy`, `pine_webhook` schema), **paper-only**, routes via **NFO → NRML**. Needs completion + paper testing.
- **CASH:** **zero execution path.** Ground-up build required. **HARDEST** — the source strategies short, but a cash short isn't deliverable → **cash = LONG-ONLY** (a different, untested strategy shape).

### Isolation architecture (protects live futures)
- **Branch on instrument-type ABOVE `place_strategy_orders`** — an explicit instrument-router at routing time, **BEFORE** the executor.
- Futures call sites **keep passing the `Exchange.NFO` constant — NEVER parameterized by data.** Cash/options get their **OWN executor entry + resolver.**
- Live futures strategies (no `instrument_type`, no `options` block) **deterministically fall through to the existing NFO path, unchanged.**
- `futures_resolver` left **byte-for-byte untouched**; options use the separate `pine_mapper` strike/expiry resolver; cash needs its own.

### Build order (lowest-risk)
1. **Isolation / instrument-router layer first** — so futures stays 100% separate + provably safe.
2. **Options next** — complete the dormant scaffold; it's partly built and F&O-adjacent.
3. **Cash last** — ground-up, long-only; hardest.
4. **All paper-validated; real-money only post-SEBI.**

### RISK FLAGS (honest record)
- Running cash/option logic on strategies originally calibrated for **FUTURES is UNTESTED** — customer-money risk. Each instrument needs **separate ground-up validation** before ANY real-money use. **NOT** a "drop the same strategy onto cash/option" shortcut.
- **Cash = long-only** loses the strategy's short engine → effectively a **different strategy**; must be tested as such.
- **Options theta-decay** materially changes the drawdown profile (founder-noted) → requires its own backtest/forward-test.
- These are flagged so the decision is **on record as informed.**

### Open design questions
- **Options:** which strike/expiry rule maps a futures-style signal (ATM? OTM? weekly/monthly?) — partly answerable from the existing `pine_mapper` resolvers.
- **Cash:** how is long-only entry/exit defined when the source strategy assumes futures long + short?
- **UX:** customer instrument-choice flow + clear Cash/Option risk warnings at subscribe time.

## INSTRUMENT-ROUTER SEAM — EXACT ENTRY POINTS (2026-06-28)

### Call chain (webhook → executor)
```
receive_strategy_signal   strategy_webhook.py:141   (HTTP POST handler; persists StrategySignal)
  └─ dispatch_signal        signal_execution.py:582  (enqueues Celery task)
       └─ execute_signal_async  signal_execution.py:86   (Celery task; routes by action_kind)
            └─ _process_entry    signal_execution.py:138  (ENTRY: shields → validate_signal → place)
                 └─ place_strategy_orders  strategy_executor.py:119   ← NFO-hardcoded FUTURES executor
```
Exits route separately: `execute_signal_async` → `_process_direct_exit` (for `PARTIAL` / `EXIT` / `SL_HIT`) → `direct_exit.py` (also NFO-hardcoded at `:257, 429, 607`).

### Router insertion points (TWO seams, both ABOVE the executors)
1. **ENTRY seam:** `signal_execution.py:324` — the `place_strategy_orders(...)` call inside `_process_entry`.
2. **EXIT seam:** the equivalent call inside `_process_direct_exit`.

Validation / shields / kill-switch run **above both seams** and are shared (unchanged).

### Design
- Add `resolve_instrument_type(strategy) -> {futures | options | cash}`, modeled on `is_options_strategy` (`pine_mapper.py:469`). **Default = `futures`** when `strategy_json` is NULL/empty or carries no instrument marker.
- **FUTURES branch = the current calls verbatim** (`place_strategy_orders` + `direct_exit`, both keep `Exchange.NFO`). **NO edit** to `strategy_executor.py`, `direct_exit.py`, or `futures_resolver.py`.
- **OPTIONS / CASH branches = new executor entries + own resolvers** (options reuse the `pine_mapper` strike/expiry resolvers; cash = its own, long-only).

### Instrument-intent carriers (existing)
- **Webhook payload:** `instrument_type` field (`schemas/strategy_webhook.py:123`, accepted-but-unconsumed — ready landing spot). `product_type` IS consumed (by `_resolve_product_type`).
- **`strategy_json["options"]` = `OptionsConfig`** (`option_type`, `strike_selection{method, offset}`, `expiry`, `premium_budget_per_lot`, `product_type` NRML/MARGIN-only, `carry_forward=true`, `expiry_day_force_close`). Futures strategies have **NO** options block.

### CRITICAL SAFETY INVARIANT (must be a regression test before anything ships)
**For any strategy with `strategy_json IS NULL` or no instrument marker, `resolve_instrument_type` MUST return `'futures'`.** DB-confirmed (2026-06-28): BSE / CDSL / ANGELONE all have `strategy_json IS NULL` → deterministically route to futures → the live real-money path is byte-for-byte unchanged.

## OPTIONS MODULE — COMPLETION PLAN (2026-06-28, read-only audit)

**STATE:** Options DECISION LOGIC is **~90% built and works** (no stubs). EXECUTION WIRING is **0% built**. The path is **FULLY DORMANT** — zero callers; BSE/CDSL/ANGELONE (`strategy_json IS NULL`) cannot reach it; the executor is NFO-hardcoded and never calls the options mapper. **Live futures 100% safe.**

### DONE (in `pine_mapper.py`, reusable, paper-testable as-is)
- `resolve_atm_strike` (306), `resolve_strike` (320, ATM/OTM/ITM), `resolve_option_type` (419, `auto`→LONG=CE/SHORT=PE), `is_options_strategy` (469), `parse_options_config` (490), `map_pine_to_option_order` (620+, builds a full `OrderRequest`).
- ATM/OTM/ITM math + `strike_step` handling.
- `OptionsConfig` schema (`pine_webhook.py:107`) + NRML-only / carry-forward validators (double-guarded by `_enforce_nrml`).
- Option scrip lookup (triplet `option_type + strike + expiry` → `ScripMeta`) over Dhan's parsed `_meta` (read-only scan, since `dhan.py` is frozen).
- Dhan can place an option `OrderRequest` via the same `(symbol, segment)` path futures use — no options-specific broker code needed.

### MISSING / TO BUILD (ordered, all gated/paper, AFTER the router-wiring brick)
1. **NEAR-EXPIRY ROLL** (decided 2-3-day theta-avoidance): `resolve_options_expiry` currently only rolls **AFTER** expiry has passed, not N days before. Add a day-threshold param + roll-to-next-month branch. **PURE LOGIC — first options brick, paper-testable, no execution needed.**
2. **WIRING:** a caller for `map_pine_to_option_order` behind the instrument-router, PLUS a placement path for the returned `OrderRequest` (the executor is frozen/NFO-hardcoded — options need their **own** placement path, not `place_strategy_orders`).
3. **EXPIRY WEEKDAY FIX:** scaffold hardcodes **Thursday** (`_WEEKLY_EXPIRY_WEEKDAY`) — but NSE moved stock F&O to **TUESDAY** (same issue already fixed in `futures_resolver`). Options expiry must use the correct (Tuesday) weekday + a per-instrument source, not hardcoded Thursday.
4. **STRIKE STEP:** `_DEFAULT_STRIKE_STEP = 100` is a flagged BSE assumption — needs a per-instrument step table verified against live contract specs.
5. **OPTIONS EXIT / LIFECYCLE:** `map_pine_to_option_order` is **ENTRY-ONLY** (rejects EXIT at `:650`). Closing an option leg has no path — must build (mirrors the futures exit gap).
6. **CONSUME declared-but-unused config:** `premium_budget_per_lot` (sizing — currently ignored; sizes by `entry_lots × lot_size`), `expiry_day_force_close`, `no_intraday_squareoff` (lifecycle).
7. **HOLIDAY CALENDAR** for expiry shift (`_shift_off_holiday` is a no-op without a `holidays` set).
8. **THETA-DECAY WARNING** at subscribe (decided) — UI, not in scaffold.

### TWO FLAGGED ASSUMPTIONS in code to verify
- Strike step (**100**).
- Expiry weekday (**Thursday — WRONG, should be Tuesday** per the NSE change).

**REMINDER:** gated on SEBI for real money; **Stage 1 = paper**. First options brick (after router-wiring) = the **near-expiry roll + paper test** (pure logic, no execution).

## ROUTER-WIRING — BUILD SPEC (Module #2, code = next session)

**GOAL:** Wire `resolve_instrument_type` (built + tested in Module #1, branch `feat/instrument-type-classifier`, 18/18 pass) into the signal flow. Branch on instrument-type: **futures → current path verbatim (untouched)**; **options/cash → their own paths (not built yet → inert skip+log for now)**. This is the MOST safety-critical edit (it touches the live signal flow).

### TWO SEAMS (both must be wired)
- **ENTRY seam:** `signal_execution.py:324` (the `place_strategy_orders` call inside `_process_entry`).
- **EXIT seam:** inside `_process_direct_exit` (which calls `direct_exit.py` for `PARTIAL` / `EXIT` / `SL_HIT`).
- Both branch on `resolve_instrument_type`. **Wiring only one leaves the other leaking to futures** (e.g. entry routes but exit doesn't) — both are required.

### LOGIC (same pattern at both seams)
```
instrument = resolve_instrument_type(strategy)
if instrument == "futures":   → EXACTLY the current call (place_strategy_orders / direct_exit),
                                verbatim, NFO-hardcoded, NRML, byte-for-byte unchanged.
                                (BSE/CDSL/ANGELONE land here: strategy_json IS NULL → "futures".)
elif instrument == "options": → options path — NOT built yet (Module #3) → for now: log + skip/reject
                                gracefully (no execution).
elif instrument == "cash":    → cash path — NOT built yet (Module #4) → for now: log + skip/reject
                                gracefully.
```

### PHASING (critical — do NOT build everything at once)
- **Step 2a (THIS brick):** add the router, but only the **futures branch** functions. options/cash = "recognized but not-yet-implemented → safe skip + log". Since ALL current strategies are futures (no options/cash strategies exist), wiring the router **changes NOTHING observable** — the futures path runs exactly as today.
- **Step 2b / 2c (LATER):** wire the options/cash branches once their executors (Modules #3 / #4) exist.

### SAFETY INVARIANT (regression test — write BEFORE/with the wiring)
When `resolve_instrument_type == "futures"` (always true for BSE/CDSL/ANGELONE), the router MUST call the existing `place_strategy_orders` / `direct_exit` with the **SAME arguments as before** — zero behavior change. Tests:
- futures strategy (`strategy_json` NULL) → entry seam → `place_strategy_orders` called with same args (NFO/NRML).
- futures strategy → exit seam → `direct_exit` called the same.
- options strategy → entry → options branch (currently skip+log, no executor).
- cash strategy → entry → cash branch (currently skip+log).
- Assert the futures call path is **byte-for-byte unchanged** (same function, same params).

### HARD RULES (do NOT touch)
- `strategy_executor.py`: **ZERO edit** (frozen futures executor).
- `direct_exit.py`: **ZERO edit**.
- `futures_resolver.py`: **ZERO edit**.
- Only `signal_execution.py` gets the router branch (2 seams), and the futures branch = exactly the current call.

### RISK
Medium-high (live signal flow), made safe by phasing: router added, all strategies stay futures, nothing changes, regression-test proves it. Real-money: post-SEBI. Stage 1 = paper.

**NEXT SESSION FIRST STEP:** write the regression test (futures fall-through unchanged) **FIRST**, then add the router branch at **both** seams with options/cash as inert skip+log.

## OPTIONS EXPIRY — CORRECTED DESIGN (mirror futures, 2026-06-28)

**KEY FINDING** (changes the earlier "Thursday→Tuesday fix" plan): the futures fix did **NOT** flip a hardcoded weekday — it **DELETED weekday computation entirely** and reads the exchange's published expiry (`SEM_EXPIRY_DATE`) from the scrip master. Options must mirror this, **NOT** just flip Thursday→Tuesday.

### Why "flip Thursday→Tuesday" is WRONG
- `resolve_options_expiry` currently **COMPUTES a guessed date** via weekday arithmetic (`_WEEKLY_EXPIRY_WEEKDAY = Thursday`, `pine_mapper.py:293`), and `_find_option_scrip` must **EXACT-MATCH** that date. A hardcoded weekday — even Tuesday — is still a guess that tracks neither holidays nor per-instrument differences → the scrip lookup would **FAIL** (no contract on the guessed date).

### Correct approach (mirror `futures_resolver`'s enumerate-and-pick)
- `futures_resolver` does **NOT** hardcode weekday: `_list_fut_contracts` enumerates contracts from the scrip master, reads each real expiry via `_ScripMaster.expiry_for(symbol, segment)` (`dhan.py:471` = `SEM_EXPIRY_DATE`, **already holiday-shifted** and **already last-Tuesday** for monthly stock F&O), sorts by real expiry, and `_pick_active_contract` picks the first with `expiry > today` (0-day buffer).
- **OPTIONS PORT:** enumerate option contracts for `(underlying, option_type)` from the scrip master, read each real `expiry_for(...)`, sort, pick the bucket by **REAL expiry**. Option rows already carry `SEM_EXPIRY_DATE` (confirmed: `_parse_expiry`, `ScripMeta.expiry_date`, and `_find_option_scrip` already matches `m.expiry_date`). `_expiry_by_symbol` is keyed `(symbol, segment)` for **ALL** F&O incl. options.
- This **DELETES `_WEEKLY_EXPIRY_WEEKDAY` entirely** and fixes Tuesday + holidays in **ONE** move.

### Near-expiry roll (the decided 2-3-day theta rule)
- Expressed as an **N-(trading-)day buffer** in the picker: where futures advances when `expiry <= today`, options advances when `expiry` is within N trading days of `reference_date` → skip to the next contract in the sorted-by-real-expiry list.

### THE ONE GENUINELY NEW PIECE (futures doesn't provide this)
- A **TRADING-DAY counter** (weekend-skip; holidays optional, since real published expiries already encode holiday shifts). **No business-day/trading-day util exists anywhere in the codebase.** Either build a small weekend-skip counter, or approximate in calendar days with a documented caveat. This is the **only** net-new logic.

### Dormancy
`resolve_options_expiry` is called only by `map_pine_to_option_order`, which has **ZERO callers** → fully unreachable → BSE/CDSL/ANGELONE never touch it → **safe to change**.

### REVISED FIRST OPTIONS BRICK (code = next session)
Port the futures enumerate-and-pick-by-real-expiry approach to options + add the N-trading-day buffer + **DELETE the hardcoded Thursday weekday** + the trading-day counter helper + tests.

> This **supersedes** plan item #1 ("near-expiry roll") and item #3 ("Thursday→Tuesday fix") from the OPTIONS MODULE — COMPLETION PLAN — they **merge into this single enumerate-by-real-expiry rewrite**.
