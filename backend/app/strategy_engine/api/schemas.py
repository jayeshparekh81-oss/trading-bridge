"""Pydantic boundary models for the Phase 5 strategies CRUD endpoints.

Two responsibilities:

    * **Inbound** — :class:`StrategyCreateRequest` wraps the canonical
      :class:`StrategyJSON` DSL so FastAPI validates the full document
      (indicators, conditions, risk caps, exec config) at the request
      boundary; handlers never see malformed input.

    * **Outbound** — :class:`StrategyResponse` is built from the
      :class:`Strategy` ORM row. ``strategy_json`` is returned as the
      stored dict (no re-validation): any future schema change must
      keep older rows readable, and re-validating on read would force
      a migration whenever the DSL evolves.
